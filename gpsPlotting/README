## Setup

In the gmplot folder execute the setup.py install script

_Linux_ : 

```
cd gmplot
sudo python setup.py install
```


Once gmplot is installed execute gpsPlotting_1.0 as follows : 

`python gpsPlotting_1.0.py <dataFile>`

Replace <dataFile> with the name of your csv file containing latitude and longitude points of ASPire's route


The script will then plot all points and create a route between them on a google map named ASPire_route.html
